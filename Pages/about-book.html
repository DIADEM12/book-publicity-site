            <h3>Why Writing This Book in His Honour is Important</h3>
            <div class="text-image-pair">
                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>Writing this book in honour of Rev’d Dr. John Oyelade is not merely an act of recognition; it is an intentional effort to preserve and commemorate a legacy that has left an indelible mark on Fountain of Peace Baptist Church, the community of Oyo, and the wider body of Christ. In the rush of everyday life, it is all too easy for remarkable stories of faith, sacrifice, and leadership to fade into the background. This book serves as a timely reminder of the power of God’s work through dedicated servants like Rev’d Dr Oyelade.</p>
                    <p>His leadership has spanned nearly two decades, a period in which he has helped shape not just a church but an entire movement of believers committed to peace, unity, and spiritual growth.</p>

            <p>It is crucial that such a transformative journey be captured and reflected upon, so that future generations can be inspired by the lessons learnt and the testimony of what God has done through his leadership. This book will not only highlight the milestones achieved under his guidance but also encourage others to embrace the mantle of leadership with humility, faith, and a deep commitment to serving God and His people.</p>
